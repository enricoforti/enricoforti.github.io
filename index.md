**Extemporaneous Coordination in Specialist Teams: The Familiarity Complementarity**

Team production is ubiquitous in the economy, but managing teams effectively remains a challenge for many organizations.  This paper studies how familiarity amongst teammates influences the performance of specialist teams, relative to non-specialist teams.  Applying theories of team production to contexts where team members coordinate interdependent activities extemporaneously, we develop predictions about factors that shift the marginal returns to specialization along two dimensions of familiarity: social familiarity and functional familiarity. We test our hypotheses in the context of DOTA2, a major e-sports game where, in some formats, players are exogenously assigned to five-person teams. After analysing nearly 6.5 million matches, we find that specialist teams are relatively more successful when members are more socially and functionally familiar with one another.  The results suggest that the “plug and play” perspective on specialist teams is incomplete; rather, specialization and familiarity are complements in dynamic environments where team members coordinate extemporaneously.

**Does VC Backing Affect Brand Strategy in New Technology Ventures?**
_—	with: Munari F. and Zhang C._

_Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal (2020)_ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sej.1318">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sej.1318</a>

The resource-based view of the firm characterizes brands as important resources for firm growth and competitive advantage. Existing studies offer theory and evidence that venture capital (VC) backing enhances the growth of new technology ventures along different dimensions. It is not clear, however, whether and how VC backing affects the development of brand assets. In a study of VC-backed and non-VC-backed nanotechnology ventures in the United Kingdom, we find a positive association between VC backing and the development of brand assets. We also find that VC-backed technology ventures tend to create brand assets with a wider scope, which can be deployed across multiple different product-markets.

**Competitive Familiarity: Learning to Coordinate by Competing**
_—	with: Ching K. and Rawley E._

_Revise & Resubmit at Organization Science_

This paper develops and tests a simple theory of organizational learning, proposing that prior competitive interaction improves coordination amongst teammates. We test the theory using millions of quasi-experiments in the formation of high-level eSports teams. The results show that exogenously assigned teams of former competitors are highly effective—the returns to prior competitive interaction are at least three times the returns to prior collaborative interaction. The evidence suggests that teammates learn to coordinate by competing, a finding with implications for organizational design and the strategic management of human capital.

**Minimally Innovative Products for Value Capture**
_—	with: Ching K._

_Revise & Resubmit at Research Policy_

Competition from replicas challenges firms to capture the value created by product innovation. We examine two key dimensions of product innovation strategy — vertical and horizontal differentiation — to study which types of new products are more or less likely to be copied. Vertical differentiation is achieved by including superior quality attributes whereas horizontal differentiation is achieved by developing new style variants of existing products. We analyze unique hand-collected data that allow to match each new product with its replicas: Gundam plastic model kits, a line of popular products developed and marketed by the Japanese firm Bandai Namco. Controlling for product popularity, price, and other confounders, results show that new style variants that include superior quality attributes are 20% more likely to be copied relative to style variants that do not. We discuss implications for product innovation under weak appropriability regimes.

**To Start or To Finish: Technology Commercialization Strategy under Ambiguity**
_—	with: Rindova V. and Jong S._

_In preparation for submission._

Scientific breakthroughs create new markets fraught with ambiguity, which makes it challenging for entrepreneurial firms to commit to competitive or cooperative commercialization strategies. They similarly struggle whether to invest their resources in pursuing a single opportunity, or to hedge their bets by pursuing multiple ones. Our inductive study of two start-ups that pioneered the cell therapy market explores how new firms navigate these dilemmas and identifies two key dynamics of ambiguity that affect entrepreneurial strategies in nascent markets: knowledge gaps hinder the execution of cooperative commercialization strategies, whereas noisy feedback strains the pursuit of competitive commercialization strategies. We theorize the effects of two different approaches to managing these frictions: sustained commitment versus opportunistic overreach.

**Continuity, Change and New Product Performance: The Role of Stream Concentration**
_—	with: Sobrero M. and Vezzulli A._

_Journal of Product Innovation Management (2020)_ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12521">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12521</a>

Product development teams often face the challenge of designing radically new products that cater at the same time to the revealed tastes and expectations of existing customers. In new product development projects, this tension guides critical choices about continuity or change concerning product attributes and team composition. Research suggests these choices interact, but it is not clear whether they are complements or substitutes and if the level of change in one should match or not the level of change in the other. In this article, we examine the interaction between product attribute change, team change, and a new team-level factor, which we term stream concentration, as it captures differences among team members in terms of familiarity with the knowledge domain of the new product being developed. We assess the effects of stream concentration on the management of change in new product development projects using longitudinal data from the music industry. We analyze 2621 new product development projects between 1962 and 2008 involving 34,265 distinct team members. Results show that stream concentration is a critical factor in new product development projects that, together with product attributes and team composition, affects new product performance. We discuss implications for research and practice.

**Community-Level Salience and Organizational Responsiveness to Social Issues: CrossFit in the Crosshairs**
_—	with: Piazza A. and Rietveld J._

_In preparation for submission_

Scandals often result in the dissolution of exchange relationships, as organizations seek to distance themselves from their suddenly problematic partners. Existing explanations of tie dissolution have focused on firm-level attributes and characteristics. In contrast, we examine defection as a function of firms’ relationships with stakeholders in the communities in which they are embedded. Leveraging a scandal that affected the fitness platform CrossFit in 2020, which caused hundreds of locally owned and operated U.S. gyms to cut ties with the company, we find that the likelihood of disaffiliation in the wake of scandal is a function of the salience of the scandal within the local community, of local network closure, and of the presence of demand disruption.
