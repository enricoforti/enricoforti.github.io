**Competitive Familiarity: Learning to Coordinate by Competing**
_—	with: Ching K. and Rawley E._

_Organization Science (2024)_ <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17068">https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17068</a> [open access] _Equally contributed. Authors listed in alphabetical order._ 

This paper develops and tests a theory of organizational learning, proposing that prior competitive interaction improves coordination amongst teammates. We test the theory using millions of experiments in the formation of eSports teams. The results show that exogenously assigned teams of former competitors are highly effective—the marginal returns to prior competitive interaction are even larger than the returns to prior collaborative interaction. The evidence suggests that teammates learn to coordinate by competing, a finding with implications for organizational design and the management of human capital.

**Extemporaneous Coordination in Specialist Teams: The Familiarity Complementarity**

Team production is ubiquitous in the economy, but managing teams effectively remains a challenge for many organizations.  This paper studies how familiarity amongst teammates influences the performance of specialist teams, relative to non-specialist teams.  Applying theories of team production to contexts where team members coordinate interdependent activities extemporaneously, we develop predictions about factors that shift the marginal returns to specialization along two dimensions of familiarity: social familiarity and functional familiarity. We test our hypotheses in the context of DOTA2, a major e-sports game where, in some formats, players are exogenously assigned to five-person teams. After analysing nearly 6.5 million matches, we find that specialist teams are relatively more successful when members are more socially and functionally familiar with one another.  The results suggest that the “plug and play” perspective on specialist teams is incomplete; rather, specialization and familiarity are complements in dynamic environments where team members coordinate extemporaneously.

**Does VC Backing Affect Brand Strategy in New Technology Ventures?**
_—	with: Munari F. and Zhang C._

_Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal (2020)_ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sej.1318">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sej.1318</a>

The resource-based view of the firm characterizes brands as important resources for firm growth and competitive advantage. Existing studies offer theory and evidence that venture capital (VC) backing enhances the growth of new technology ventures along different dimensions. It is not clear, however, whether and how VC backing affects the development of brand assets. In a study of VC-backed and non-VC-backed nanotechnology ventures in the United Kingdom, we find a positive association between VC backing and the development of brand assets. We also find that VC-backed technology ventures tend to create brand assets with a wider scope, which can be deployed across multiple different product-markets.

**CrossFit in the Crosshairs: A Community-Embedded Theory of Organizational Responsiveness to Social Issues**
_—	with: Piazza A. and Rietveld J._

_Revise & Resubmit (2nd Round) at Administrative Science Quarterly_

How do community characteristics shape organizational responses to social issues? While existing research has focused primarily on firm-level attributes or issue characteristics, we argue that a community's social structure systematically affects how external issues penetrate and resonate locally. We develop a theory of community permeability that links three structural features—network closure, segregation patterns, and issue connectedness—to both the local salience of social issues and subsequent firm responses. Our empirical analysis examines how thousands of locally owned CrossFit gyms responded to their CEO's controversial statements following George Floyd's death in 2020. Results show that issue salience is lower in communities characterized by stronger inward-focused ties and greater ethnic segregation, but higher in communities more directly connected to affected populations. Firms operating in communities where the issue is more salient are more likely to respond, particularly when their dependence on community support is heightened by disruptions unrelated to the issue. Our study reveals how community social structure creates systematic variation in both issue salience and organizational responses, advancing understanding of when and why firms act on social issues.

**Style and Quality: Aesthetic Innovation Strategy under Weak Appropriability**
_—	with: ^Ching K., Katsampes S,  Mammous K._

_Research Policy (2024)_ <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733323002317">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733323002317</a> [open access] _^ These authors contributed equally. Authors listed in alphabetical order._

Counterfeiting challenges firms to capture the value created by product innovation. We characterize style and quality as key dimensions of product innovation strategy in contexts where aesthetic attributes drive product success. We examine distinct aesthetic innovation strategies that firms may use to innovate their existing products — developing new style variants, using higher quality attributes, or both. Our empirical test exploits unique data on authentic plastic model kits matched to product-specific counterfeits. Controlling for several confounders, we find that new style variants that include higher quality attributes are 20% more likely to be copied relative to style variants that do not. We discuss implications for aesthetic innovation strategies in weak appropriability regimes.

**To Start or To Finish: Technology Commercialization Strategy under Ambiguity**
_—	with: Rindova V. and Jong S._

_In preparation for submission._

Scientific breakthroughs create new markets fraught with ambiguity, which makes it challenging for entrepreneurial firms to commit to competitive or cooperative commercialization strategies. They similarly struggle whether to invest their resources in pursuing a single opportunity, or to hedge their bets by pursuing multiple ones. Our inductive study of two start-ups that pioneered the cell therapy market explores how new firms navigate these dilemmas and identifies two key dynamics of ambiguity that affect entrepreneurial strategies in nascent markets: knowledge gaps hinder the execution of cooperative commercialization strategies, whereas noisy feedback strains the pursuit of competitive commercialization strategies. We theorize the effects of two different approaches to managing these frictions: sustained commitment versus opportunistic overreach.

**Continuity, Change and New Product Performance: The Role of Stream Concentration**
_—	with: Sobrero M. and Vezzulli A._

_Journal of Product Innovation Management (2020)_ <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12521">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12521</a>

Product development teams often face the challenge of designing radically new products that cater at the same time to the revealed tastes and expectations of existing customers. In new product development projects, this tension guides critical choices about continuity or change concerning product attributes and team composition. Research suggests these choices interact, but it is not clear whether they are complements or substitutes and if the level of change in one should match or not the level of change in the other. In this article, we examine the interaction between product attribute change, team change, and a new team-level factor, which we term stream concentration, as it captures differences among team members in terms of familiarity with the knowledge domain of the new product being developed. We assess the effects of stream concentration on the management of change in new product development projects using longitudinal data from the music industry. We analyze 2621 new product development projects between 1962 and 2008 involving 34,265 distinct team members. Results show that stream concentration is a critical factor in new product development projects that, together with product attributes and team composition, affects new product performance. We discuss implications for research and practice.

**Naturals over Strivers: Perceived Naturalness Increases Resource Allocation**
_—	with: Lee J. and Tsay C._

_Under review_

Shortages intensify scrutiny of resource-allocation practices in healthcare settings. Although evaluators ostensibly value striving and hard work as rationing criteria, in actual resource allocation choices in a large-scale field study of 268,679 emergency crowdfunding campaigns and in three experiments, we find that candidates perceived to be more “naturally” advantaged are deemed more deserving of healthcare resources than hard-working “strivers.” We observe a preference for naturalness in resource-allocation decisions across a wide range of situations and types of resources, including medications, hospital equipment, and financial support. This documented preference for naturalness has important implications for contexts plagued by shortages and rationing. We discuss practical mechanisms that could help debias decision-making processes and new strategies for addressing the psychological, health, and moral consequences of resource allocation under scarcity.
